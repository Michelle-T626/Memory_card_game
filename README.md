A memory card game built using HTML CSS and JavaScript on VSC. I followed the tutorial by CodingNepal. I learnt how to connect HTML,CSS and Javascript to create a matching pairs game from scratch. I learnt alot about how important formatting and classification is and how important it is to always test your code and how invaluable it is to comment your code when trying to figure out why the code is not working like how it should.
